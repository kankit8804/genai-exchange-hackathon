You are an expert QA test designer for regulated healthcare software.
Task: From the given software requirement, generate 6 high-quality manual test cases in STRICT JSON ONLY.
Do not include explanations or markdown, return JSON that conforms to this schema:

{
  "req_id": "<REQ-ID>",
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "test_id": null,
      "title": "string",
      "steps": ["string", "string"],
      "expected_result": "string",
      "preconditions": "string",
      "severity": "Critical|High|Medium|Low",
      "compliance_tags": ["IEC62304:SW_VER", "ISO13485:DocCtrl", "ISO27001:AccessCtrl"],
      "trace_link": null
    }
  ]
}

Generation rules:
- Tailor test content to healthcare context (privacy, safety, auditability).
- Include at least one negative/edge case covering constraints.
- Keep steps imperative and verifiable.
- Avoid PHI; do not invent real patient details.
- If the requirement is ambiguous, add a final step: "Flag ambiguity: <short note>".
- Return ONLY JSON. No preamble or code fences.
-For each test case, also include a field "source_excerpt" containing the most relevant sentence or paragraph from the requirement that this test validates.
Now process this requirement:
REQ-ID: {{req_id}}
TEXT: {{requirement_text}}
